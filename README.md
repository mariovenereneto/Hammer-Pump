# Hammer Pump

This project is a Python-based GUI application that interacts with a map, calculates distances, and performs hydraulic calculations for determining the flow and pressure using height and water availability data. It uses PyQt5 for the GUI, folium for the map, and requests for HTTP requests to the Google API and the Mapa de Vaz√µes, a brazillian project for water availability estimation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following packages installed:

- PyQt5
- folium
- requests
- scipy

You can install them using pip:

```python
pip install PyQt5 folium requests scipy
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the directory containing the `Interface.py` file and run the following command:

```python
python Interface.py
```

## Features

The application has the following features:

- Interact with a map to select coordinates.
- Calculate the distance between two points on the Earth's surface, taking into account the difference in altitude.
- Perform hydraulic calculations using the Darcy-Weisbach equation.
- Extract specific values from a web page using HTTP requests (Google API Key and authorization required).

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used.
- [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) - Used to create the GUI.
- [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) - Used to interact with the map.
- [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - Used to send HTTP requests.
